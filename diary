help exist
 <strong>exist</strong>  Check existence of variable, script, function, folder, or class
    <strong>exist</strong>(NAME) returns:
      0 if NAME does not exist
      1 if NAME is a variable in the workspace
      2 if NAME is a file with extension .m, .mlx, .mlapp, or .sfx, or NAME
        is the name of a file with a non-registered file extension 
        (.mat, .fig, .txt).
      3 if NAME is a MEX-file on the MATLAB search path
      4 if NAME is a Simulink model or library file on the MATLAB search path
      5 if NAME is a built-in MATLAB function. This does not include classes
      6 if NAME is a P-code file on the MATLAB search path
      7 if NAME is a folder
      8 if NAME is a class (<strong>exist</strong> returns 0 for Java classes if you
        start MATLAB with the -nojvm option.)
 
    <strong>exist</strong>(NAME,'builtin') checks only for built-in functions.
    <strong>exist</strong>(NAME,'class') checks only for classes.
    <strong>exist</strong>(NAME,'dir') checks only for folders.
    <strong>exist</strong>(NAME,'file') checks for files or folders.
    <strong>exist</strong>(NAME,'var') checks only for variables.
 
    NAME can include a partial path, but must be in a folder on the search
    path, or in the current folder. Otherwise, name must include a full path.
 
    If NAME specifies a file with a non-registered file extension 
    (.mat, .fig, .txt), include the extension.
 
    NAME is case insensitive on Windows systems, and case sensitive for 
    files and folder on UNIX systems.
 
    MATLAB does not examine the contents or internal structure of a file 
    and relies solely on the file extension for classification.

help plot
 <strong>plot</strong>   Linear plot. 
    <strong>plot</strong>(X,Y) plots vector Y versus vector X. If X or Y is a matrix,
    then the vector is plotted versus the rows or columns of the matrix,
    whichever line up.  If X is a scalar and Y is a vector, disconnected
    line objects are created and plotted as discrete points vertically at
    X.
 
    <strong>plot</strong>(Y) plots the columns of Y versus their index.
    If Y is complex, <strong>plot</strong>(Y) is equivalent to <strong>plot</strong>(real(Y),imag(Y)).
    In all other uses of <strong>plot</strong>, the imaginary part is ignored.
 
    Various line types, plot symbols and colors may be obtained with
    <strong>plot</strong>(X,Y,S) where S is a character string made from one element
    from any or all the following 3 columns:
 
           b     blue          .     point              -     solid
           g     green         o     circle             :     dotted
           r     red           x     x-mark             -.    dashdot 
           c     cyan          +     plus               --    dashed   
           m     magenta       *     star             (none)  no line
           y     yellow        s     square
           k     black         d     diamond
           w     white         v     triangle (down)
                               ^     triangle (up)
                               <     triangle (left)
                               >     triangle (right)
                               p     pentagram
                               h     hexagram
                          
    For example, <strong>plot</strong>(X,Y,'c+:') plots a cyan dotted line with a plus 
    at each data point; <strong>plot</strong>(X,Y,'bd') plots blue diamond at each data 
    point but does not draw any line.
 
    <strong>plot</strong>(TBL,XVAR,YVAR) plots the variables xvar and yvar from the table
    tbl. To plot one data set, specify one variable for xvar and one
    variable for yvar. To plot multiple data sets, specify multiple
    variables for xvar, yvar, or both. If both arguments specify multiple
    variables, they must specify the same number of variables
  
    <strong>plot</strong>(TBL,YVAR) plots the specified variable from the table against the
    row indices in the table. If the table is a timetable, the specified
    variable is plotted against the row times from the timetable.
 
    <strong>plot</strong>(X1,Y1,S1,X2,Y2,S2,X3,Y3,S3,...) combines the plots defined by
    the (X,Y,S) triples, where the X's and Y's are vectors or matrices 
    and the S's are strings.  
 
    For example, <strong>plot</strong>(X,Y,'y-',X,Y,'go') plots the data twice, with a
    solid yellow line interpolating green circles at the data points.
 
    The <strong>plot</strong> command, if no color is specified, makes automatic use of
    the colors specified by the axes ColorOrder property.  By default,
    <strong>plot</strong> cycles through the colors in the ColorOrder property.  For
    monochrome systems, <strong>plot</strong> cycles over the axes LineStyleOrder property.
 
    Note that RGB colors in the ColorOrder property may differ from
    similarly-named colors in the (X,Y,S) triples.  For example, the 
    second axes ColorOrder property is medium green with RGB [0 .5 0],
    while <strong>plot</strong>(X,Y,'g') plots a green line with RGB [0 1 0].
 
    If you do not specify a marker type, <strong>plot</strong> uses no marker. 
    If you do not specify a line style, <strong>plot</strong> uses a solid line.
 
    <strong>plot</strong>(AX,...) plots into the axes with handle AX.
 
    <strong>plot</strong> returns a column vector of handles to lineseries objects, one
    handle per plotted line. 
 
    The X,Y pairs, or X,Y,S triples, can be followed by 
    parameter/value pairs to specify additional properties 
    of the lines. For example, <strong>plot</strong>(X,Y,'LineWidth',2,'Color',[.6 0 0]) 
    will create a plot with a dark red line width of 2 points.
 
    Example
       x = -pi:pi/10:pi;
       y = tan(sin(x)) - sin(tan(x));
       plot(x,y,'--rs','LineWidth',2,...
                       'MarkerEdgeColor','k',...
                       'MarkerFaceColor','g',...
                       'MarkerSize',10)

help histogram
 <strong>histogram</strong>  Plots a histogram.
    <strong>histogram</strong>(X) plots a histogram of X. <strong>histogram</strong> uses an automatic binning 
    algorithm that returns bins with a uniform width, chosen to cover the 
    range of elements in X and reveal the underlying shape of the distribution.  
    X can be of numeric, datetime, or duration types, and can be a vector, 
    matrix, or multidimensional array. If X is not a vector, then <strong>histogram</strong> 
    treats it as a single column vector, X(:), and plots a single histogram.
 
    <strong>histogram</strong>(X,M), where M is a scalar, uses M bins.
 
    <strong>histogram</strong>(X,EDGES), where EDGES is a vector, specifies the edges of 
    the bins.
 
    The value X(i) is in the kth bin if EDGES(k) <= X(i) < EDGES(k+1). The 
    last bin will also include the right edge such that it will contain X(i)
    if EDGES(end-1) <= X(i) <= EDGES(end).
 
    <strong>histogram</strong>(...,'BinWidth',BW) uses bins of width BW. If X is datetime, 
    BW must be a scalar duration or calendarDuration. To prevent from accidentally
    creating too many bins, a maximum of 65536 bins can be created when
    specifying 'BinWidth'. If BW is too small such that more bins
    are needed, <strong>histogram</strong> uses a larger bin width corresponding 
    to the maximum number of bins.
 
    <strong>histogram</strong>(...,'BinLimits',[BMIN,BMAX]) plots a histogram with only 
    elements in X between BMIN and BMAX inclusive, X(X>=BMIN & X<=BMAX).
 
    <strong>histogram</strong>(...,'Normalization',NM) specifies the normalization scheme 
    of the histogram values. The normalization scheme affects the scaling 
    of the histogram along the vertical axis (or horizontal axis if 
    Orientation is 'horizontal'). NM can be:
                   'count'   The height of each bar is the number of 
                             observations in each bin. The sum of the
                             bar heights is generally equal to NUMEL(X),
                             but is less than if some of the input 
                             data is not included in the bins.
             'probability'   The height of each bar is the relative 
                             number of observations (number of observations
                             in bin / total number of observations), and
                             the sum of the bar heights is less than or 
                             equal to 1.
            'countdensity'   The height of each bar is the number of 
                             observations in each bin / width of bin. The 
                             area (height * width) of each bar is the number
                             of observations in the bin, and the sum of
                             the bar areas is less than or equal to NUMEL(X). 
                             This option is not supported for datetime or 
                             duration data.
                     'pdf'   Probability density function estimate. The height 
                             of each bar is, (number of observations in bin)
                             / (total number of observations * width of bin).
                             The area of each bar is the relative number of
                             observations, and the sum of the bar areas is 
                             less than or equal to 1. This option is not 
                             supported for datetime or duration data.
                'cumcount'   The height of each bar is the cumulative 
                             number of observations in each bin and all
                             previous bins. The height of the last bar
                             is less than or equal to NUMEL(X).
                     'cdf'   Cumulative density function estimate. The height 
                             of each bar is the cumulative relative number
                             of observations in each bin and all previous bins.
                             The height of the last bar is less than or equal 
                             to 1.
 
    <strong>histogram</strong>(...,'DisplayStyle',STYLE) specifies the display style of the 
    histogram. STYLE can be:
                     'bar'   Display a histogram bar plot. This is the default.
                  'stairs'   Display a stairstep plot, which shows the 
                             outlines of the histogram without filling the 
                             interior. 
 
    <strong>histogram</strong>(...,'BinMethod',BM), uses the specified automatic binning 
    algorithm to determine the number and width of the bins. BM can be:
                    'auto'   The default 'auto' algorithm chooses a bin 
                             width to cover the data range and reveal the 
                             shape of the underlying distribution.
                   'scott'   Scott's rule is optimal if the data is close  
                             to being normally distributed, but is also 
                             appropriate for most other distributions. It 
                             uses a bin width of 
                             3.5*STD(X(:))*NUMEL(X)^(-1/3).
                      'fd'   The Freedman-Diaconis rule is less sensitive  
                             to outliers in the data, and may be more 
                             suitable for data with heavy-tailed 
                             distributions. It uses a bin width of 
                             2*IQR(X(:))*NUMEL(X)^(-1/3), where IQR is the 
                             interquartile range.
                'integers'   The integer rule is useful with integer data, 
                             as it creates a bin for each integer. It uses 
                             a bin width of 1 and places bin edges halfway 
                             between integers. This option is not 
                             supported for datetime or duration data.
                 'sturges'   Sturges' rule is a simple rule that is popular
                             due to its simplicity. It chooses the number 
                             of bins to be CEIL(1 + LOG2(NUMEL(X))).
                    'sqrt'   The Square Root rule is another simple rule 
                             widely used in other software packages. It 
                             chooses the number of bins to be
                             CEIL(SQRT(NUMEL(X))).
    For datetime data, BM can also be the following time units: 'second', 
    'minute', 'hour', 'day', 'week', 'month', 'quarter', 'year', 'decade', 
    or 'century'. For duration data, BM can be these time units: 'second', 
    'minute', 'hour', 'day', 'year'. If BM is a time unit, <strong>histogram</strong> places 
    bin edges at boundaries of the time unit.
 
    To prevent from accidentally creating too many bins, a maximum of 65536 
    bins can be created when specifying 'BinMethod'. If the data range is 
    too large and more bins are needed, <strong>histogram</strong> uses a larger bin width 
    corresponding to the maximum number of bins.
 
    <strong>histogram</strong>(...,NAME,VALUE) set the property NAME to VALUE. 
      
    <strong>histogram</strong>('BinEdges', EDGES, 'BinCounts', COUNTS) where COUNTS is a 
    vector of length equal to length(EDGES)-1, manually specifies
    the bin counts. <strong>histogram</strong> plots the counts and does not do any data binning.
 
    <strong>histogram</strong>(AX,...) plots into AX instead of the current axes.
        
    H = <strong>histogram</strong>(...) also returns a histogram object. Use this to inspect 
    and adjust the properties of the histogram.
 
    Class support for inputs X, EDGES:
       float: double, single
       integers: uint8, int8, uint16, int16, uint32, int32, uint64, int64
       logical
       datetime, duration

help bar
 <strong>bar</strong> Bar graph.
    <strong>bar</strong>(X,Y) draws the columns of the M-by-N matrix Y as M groups of N
    vertical bars.  The vector X must not have duplicate values.
 
    <strong>bar</strong>(Y) uses the default value of X=1:M.  For vector inputs, <strong>bar</strong>(X,Y)
    or <strong>bar</strong>(Y) draws LENGTH(Y) bars.  The colors are set by the colormap.
 
    <strong>bar</strong>(X,Y,WIDTH) or <strong>bar</strong>(Y,WIDTH) specifies the width of the bars. Values
    of WIDTH > 1, produce overlapped bars.  The default value is WIDTH=0.8
 
    <strong>bar</strong>(...,'grouped') produces the default vertical grouped bar chart.
 
    <strong>bar</strong>(...,'stacked') produces a vertical stacked bar chart.
 
    <strong>bar</strong>(...,COLOR) uses the line color specified.  Specify the color as one of
    these values: 'r', 'g', 'b', 'y', 'm', 'c', 'k', or 'w'.
 
    <strong>bar</strong>(AX,...) plots into AX instead of GCA.
 
    H = <strong>bar</strong>(...) returns a vector of handles to Bar objects.
 
    Examples: subplot(3,1,1), bar(rand(10,5),'stacked')
              subplot(3,1,2), bar(0:.25:1,rand(5),1)
              subplot(3,1,3), bar(rand(2,3),.75,'grouped')

help plot -displayBanner
--- help for <strong>plot</strong> ---

 <strong>plot</strong>   Linear plot. 
    <strong>plot</strong>(X,Y) plots vector Y versus vector X. If X or Y is a matrix,
    then the vector is plotted versus the rows or columns of the matrix,
    whichever line up.  If X is a scalar and Y is a vector, disconnected
    line objects are created and plotted as discrete points vertically at
    X.
 
    <strong>plot</strong>(Y) plots the columns of Y versus their index.
    If Y is complex, <strong>plot</strong>(Y) is equivalent to <strong>plot</strong>(real(Y),imag(Y)).
    In all other uses of <strong>plot</strong>, the imaginary part is ignored.
 
    Various line types, plot symbols and colors may be obtained with
    <strong>plot</strong>(X,Y,S) where S is a character string made from one element
    from any or all the following 3 columns:
 
           b     blue          .     point              -     solid
           g     green         o     circle             :     dotted
           r     red           x     x-mark             -.    dashdot 
           c     cyan          +     plus               --    dashed   
           m     magenta       *     star             (none)  no line
           y     yellow        s     square
           k     black         d     diamond
           w     white         v     triangle (down)
                               ^     triangle (up)
                               <     triangle (left)
                               >     triangle (right)
                               p     pentagram
                               h     hexagram
                          
    For example, <strong>plot</strong>(X,Y,'c+:') plots a cyan dotted line with a plus 
    at each data point; <strong>plot</strong>(X,Y,'bd') plots blue diamond at each data 
    point but does not draw any line.
 
    <strong>plot</strong>(TBL,XVAR,YVAR) plots the variables xvar and yvar from the table
    tbl. To plot one data set, specify one variable for xvar and one
    variable for yvar. To plot multiple data sets, specify multiple
    variables for xvar, yvar, or both. If both arguments specify multiple
    variables, they must specify the same number of variables
  
    <strong>plot</strong>(TBL,YVAR) plots the specified variable from the table against the
    row indices in the table. If the table is a timetable, the specified
    variable is plotted against the row times from the timetable.
 
    <strong>plot</strong>(X1,Y1,S1,X2,Y2,S2,X3,Y3,S3,...) combines the plots defined by
    the (X,Y,S) triples, where the X's and Y's are vectors or matrices 
    and the S's are strings.  
 
    For example, <strong>plot</strong>(X,Y,'y-',X,Y,'go') plots the data twice, with a
    solid yellow line interpolating green circles at the data points.
 
    The <strong>plot</strong> command, if no color is specified, makes automatic use of
    the colors specified by the axes ColorOrder property.  By default,
    <strong>plot</strong> cycles through the colors in the ColorOrder property.  For
    monochrome systems, <strong>plot</strong> cycles over the axes LineStyleOrder property.
 
    Note that RGB colors in the ColorOrder property may differ from
    similarly-named colors in the (X,Y,S) triples.  For example, the 
    second axes ColorOrder property is medium green with RGB [0 .5 0],
    while <strong>plot</strong>(X,Y,'g') plots a green line with RGB [0 1 0].
 
    If you do not specify a marker type, <strong>plot</strong> uses no marker. 
    If you do not specify a line style, <strong>plot</strong> uses a solid line.
 
    <strong>plot</strong>(AX,...) plots into the axes with handle AX.
 
    <strong>plot</strong> returns a column vector of handles to lineseries objects, one
    handle per plotted line. 
 
    The X,Y pairs, or X,Y,S triples, can be followed by 
    parameter/value pairs to specify additional properties 
    of the lines. For example, <strong>plot</strong>(X,Y,'LineWidth',2,'Color',[.6 0 0]) 
    will create a plot with a dark red line width of 2 points.
 
    Example
       x = -pi:pi/10:pi;
       y = tan(sin(x)) - sin(tan(x));
       plot(x,y,'--rs','LineWidth',2,...
                       'MarkerEdgeColor','k',...
                       'MarkerFaceColor','g',...
                       'MarkerSize',10)

help yline
 <strong>yline</strong> create a horizontal line
    <strong>yline</strong>(VALUES) creates constant lines at the specified values of y.
    VALUE can be either a scalar or a vector. For example, yline(5) creates
    a line at y = 5.  In 2-D views, the line is typically a horizontal
    line. In 3-D views, the line appears in the xy-plane in the middle of
    the z-axis limits. This input can be vectorized.
    
    <strong>yline</strong>(VALUES, LINESPEC) specifies either the line style, the color, or 
    both. For example, ':' creates a dotted line, 'r' creates a red line, 
    and 'r:' creates a dotted, red line.
 
    <strong>yline</strong>(VALUES, LINESPEC, LABELS) adds the specified labels to the lines.
    When VALUES contains multiple elements, you can display different
    labels for each line by specifying LABELS as either cell array of
    character vectors or a string array with the same number of elements as
    VALUES. Alternatively, specify LABELS as a character vector or a string
    scalar to display the same label on all the lines.
 
    <strong>yline</strong>(...Name,Value) specifies ConstantLine properties using one or 
    more name-value pair arguments. Specify name-value pairs after all 
    other input arguments.
 
    <strong>yline</strong>(AX, ...) creates the line in the axes specified by ax instead of
    in the current axes (gca). 
 
    YL = <strong>yline</strong>(...) returns the line. Use YL to modify the ConstantLine
    object after it is created.

help fullfile
 <strong>fullfile</strong> Build full file name from parts.
    F = fullfile(FOLDERNAME1, FOLDERNAME2, ..., FILENAME) builds a full
    file specification F from the folders and file name specified. Input
    arguments FOLDERNAME1, FOLDERNAME2, etc. and FILENAME can be strings,
    character vectors, or cell arrays of character vectors. Non-scalar
    strings and cell arrays of character vectors must all be the same size.
 
    If any input is a string array, F is a string array. Otherwise, if any
    input is a cell array, F is a cell array.  Otherwise, F is a character
    array.
 
    The output of <strong>fullfile</strong> is conceptually equivalent to character vector
    horzcat operation:
 
       F = [FOLDERNAME1 filesep FOLDERNAME2 filesep ... filesep FILENAME]
 
    except that care is taken to handle the cases when the folders begin or
    end with a file separator.
 
    <strong>fullfile</strong> collapses inner repeated file separators unless they appear at 
    the beginning of the full file specification. <strong>fullfile</strong> also collapses 
    relative folders indicated by the dot symbol, unless they appear at 
    the end of the full file specification. Relative folders indicated 
    by the double-dot symbol are not collapsed.
 
    To split a full file name into folder parts, use split(f, filesep).
 
    Examples
      % To build platform dependent paths to files:
         fullfile(matlabroot,'toolbox','matlab','general','Contents.m')
 
      % To build platform dependent paths to a folder:
         fullfile(matlabroot,'toolbox','matlab',filesep)
 
      % To build a collection of platform dependent paths to files:
         fullfile(toolboxdir('matlab'),'iofun',{'filesep.m';'fullfile.m'})
